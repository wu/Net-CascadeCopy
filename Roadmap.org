* cleaner implementation

  - current implementation is not pretty (craptastic even)

  - probably mouse-based



* optionally specify 'gold server'

  - dc-specific gold server
    - default global gold server
    - no gold server specified = use current host

  - one xfer per gold server, or use gold server as an ordinary source


* use a single persistent connection to each host

  - fork child processes for each scp/rsync command
    - seems like a good place for GRID::Launcher




* progress info

  - report status of individual copies

  - GRID::Shell can help with this
    - GRID::Shell::Agent forks a process for rsync/scp



* rename ?

  - 'cascade copy' was probably a bad idea

  - GRID-Copy ?
    - google finds 21,200 for "grid copy"


* dry run

  - not sure how to do this

  - find + md5 + Algorithm::Diff ?
